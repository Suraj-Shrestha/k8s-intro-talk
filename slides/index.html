				<section>
					<h2>Agenda</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>What is Kubernetes (k8s)?</li>
						<li>What problems do k8s solve?</li>
						<li>k8s concepts</li>
						<li>Example that shows concepts and more inner workings</li>

					<h2>What is Kubernetes (k8s)?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Originally invented at Google, based upon their Borg software</li>
						<li>Container orchestration</li>
						<lI>Infrastructure component</lI>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<!-- What it is used for -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>What problems do k8s solve?</h2>

						<p>Solves many issues usually solved manually or by in-house tools and scripts</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h2>Handle that a correct number of instances of a service is always available</h2>

						<p>Even when a Node in your Cluster suddenly breaks or is unavailable</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Gradual rollouts - No downtime</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Security: Limiting access to containers outside the cluster</h2>
					</section>

					<!-- TOOD: include load balancing? Even though that is mostly a cloud provider thing? -->
				</section>



				<!-- TODO: teaser? running single container? Executing commands with kubectl exec? kubectl logs? kubectl describe and so on? -->

				<!-- TODO: have a seperate section for kubectl and basic operations? Maybe after the concepts? -->
				

				<!-- Main concepts -->
				<section>
					<!-- TODO: maybe we should take some time to put yaml examples and so on here? -->

					<!-- TODO: should these be covered?
					   - labels
					   -configs for services (clusterip, loadbalancer, nodeport)
					   - DNS entries?
					   - Liveness and readiness probes?
					   - Volumes (which is basically the same as for Docker)
					   -->

						<h2>k8s concepts</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Nodes</li>
							<li>Pods</li>
							<li>Deployments</li>
							<li>Services</li>
							<li>...</li>
							<li>Other concepts</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>k8s concepts: Nodes</h2>

						<p>Physical machine or virtual machine in your cluster</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h2>k8s concepts: Pods</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Lowest unit in k8s</li>
							<li>Contain one or more containers (usually just one)</li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<!-- TODO: maybe have something about replicasets here! -->
					<section>
						<h2>k8s concepts: Deployments</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>k8s concepts: Services</h2>
					</section>


					<!-- mention concepts not mentioned above here.. -->
					<section>
						<h2>Other concepts</h2>

						Several other concepts, which include:
						<ul>
							<li>Physical volumes / Physical volume claims</li>
							<li>...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					

					<!-- TODO: What other concepts should we cover? Is Endpoints worth covering because of older services outside and the database? Jobs?  -->
				</section>


				<!-- TODO: where should more practical things be covered? Dns, yaml examples and so on. Use an example to cover it? -->
				
				
				<section>
					<h2>Recommended resources</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>KataCoda</li>
						<li>Kubernetes for Developers by Joseph Heck (Packt Pub book)</li>
						<li>Kubernetes kubectl cheatsheet</li>
						<li>Docker CLI to kubectl</li>
					</ul>
